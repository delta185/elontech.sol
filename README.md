ElonTech (ETCH) contract ETCH protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from BEE with some added benefits. First, the dev has minted the tokens - sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burned the remainder of the tokens. Dev had to partake in presale. Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 4 years. Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #ElonTech join us on our journey to the World biggest Tech Valleys!

The aim is to hit $1 target by the end of this year. So, get and remain hodlers.
